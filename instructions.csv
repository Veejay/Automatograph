It is impossible to remain completely still, so just relax and we will record your small hand movements. Do you have any questions?","Now please place your fingers on the planchette, as lightly as you can, and focus on the fixation point until we have finished."

Let us know when you reach the answer. Do you have any questions?","Now please place your fingers on the planchette,  as lightly as you can, focus on the fixation point and when I will tell you, start moving the planchette."

Just relax with your fingers resting lightly on the planchette. Then you will start to counting backwards from 1000 by (digit from 6 to 9). When I will tell you to stop you will give me the most recent answer.
